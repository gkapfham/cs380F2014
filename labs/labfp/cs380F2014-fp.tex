\section*{Introduction}

Throughout the semester, you have learned more about the basics of data management by studying, in a hands-on fashion,
topics such as the use of the structured query language, the implementation of database applications, and the creation
and parsing of XML files.  This final project invites you to explore, in greater detail, an advanced topic in the field
of databases. You will learn more about how to implement, evaluate, and/or simulate key components or aspects of a
database. 

Your project should result in a detailed report that is, ideally, formatted with the \LaTeX\ text processing language
and suitable for publication in a conference or workshop.  The report should include a description of why the chosen
topic is important and discuss the implementation and/or experimentation that you undertook.  The written material
should be precise, formal, appropriately formatted, grammatically correct, informative, and interesting.  The source
code that you write must be carefully documented and tested.  If you install and use a data management framework, the
steps for installation and use should be clearly documented. 

\section*{Description of the Topics}

Each member of the class is invited to pick one of the following projects.  Please note that an individual selecting the
student-designed project must first discuss their idea with the instructor, during today's laboratory session, and
receive feedback and then final approval.  Please note that you are fully responsible for ensuring the feasibility of
the project that you propose.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item {\bf Evaluating the Performance of Relational Databases}: Use and/or extend systems like PolePosition,
    Database-Benchmark, or HammerDB to measure the performance of different relational databases.  This project would
    consider both in-memory databases like HSQLDB and standard databases like SQLite.  Students who select this project
    may also implement their own performance benchmarks for relational databases.  The benchmarks and
    the empirical study should, if possible, consider both the time and space overhead of the database.

  \item {\bf Exploring Relational Database Internals}: Implement and test one or more of the key data structures or
    components within a relational database.  For example, you might implement the B+ tree that is described in your
    textbook, write a JUnit test suite for the B+ tree, and building a simple benchmarking framework to measure the
    performance of your tree under a variety of workloads.  Alternatively, you may use OpenGL, or other suitable
    technologies, to visualize the behavior of the B+ tree insertion and deletion algorithms.

  \item {\bf Implementing and Testing Database-Centric Applications}: Use the standard Java database connectivity (JDBC)
    interface to interact with a relational database.  You should implement one or more substantial applications and
    test suites.  Students may consider using the DBUnit testing framework when they are testing their applications.
    The final report about your database application should include visualizations of the schemas and clear
    documentation that explains how the program interacts with the database.  Students who select this project are
    encouraged to release their system as a free and open source program.  

  \item {\bf Empirical Evaluation of the Java String Analyzer}: Many database-centric applications submit strings to the
    relational database management system via JDBC.  Use the Java String Analyzer (JSA) to build finite state machines
    (FSMs) of the full range of strings that can flow to a specific database interaction point.  Students who pick this
    project will install JSA and then use it to conduct experiments to characterize the size and structure of the finite
    state machines the tool produces.  As part of this project, you will be required to download and install Java
    database applications that use both strings and JDBC.  

  \item {\bf XML Applications with DOM and SAX}: Learn how to write Java programs with simple API for XML (SAX) or
    document object model (DOM) parsers and then implement and test at least one case study application that use these
    different XML processing techniques.  Students who pick this project should study how the use of different XML
    parsers influences your implementation progress and the overall performance of your application.  

  \item {\bf Using and Evaluating XML Compression Algorithms}: As part of this project, you will download and install
    several XML compression tools.  After installing these tools and ensuring that they work properly, you will
    implement a benchmarking framework that measures the efficiency and effectiveness of the compression and
    decompression routines.  Students may consider evaluating techniques such as XMLPPM and XMill. If you pick this
    project, then you must allocate time to read the literature about XML compression and consult the XMLCompBench,
    available from SourceForge.  Students who select this project should also incorporate standard compression
    techniques like those found in GZip, BZip, and Zip.

  \item {\bf Using XML for Data Interchange}: Use XML to enable two different applications to exchange data in a
    seamless fashion.  For example, you might implement or find a C++ program that uses its own proprietary
    representation to store data.  After learning about this system and its internal representation, you should enhance
    it to output XML that can be read by a Java program using tools like XStream, SAX, or DOM.  As part of this project,
    you will conduct a series of detailed experiments to measure the performance of the data interchange.  
    
\end{enumerate} 

\section*{Final Project Deadlines}

This assignment invites you to submit printed and signed versions of the following deliverables:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item {\bf Project Assigned:} April 7, 2014

    After meeting with your team members, pick a topic for your final project.  Remember, if you select the
    student-designed project, you must first have your project verified by the course instructor.  Next, make sure that
    you create a Git repository that can be accessed by all members of the team. Finally, write and submit a
    one-paragraph description of your idea.

  \item {\bf Project Proposal}: April 14, 2014

    You and your team will submit a one-page proposal that describes the idea for your final project.  The proposal
    should have an informative title, an abstract, a description of the main idea, a plan for completing the work, and
    an initial listing of the roles for \mbox{each member}. 

  \item {\bf Status Update}: April 21, 2014

    You and your team will submit a one-page status update that describes the finalized roles of each team member,
    explains the tasks that you have already completed, and outlines a plan for ensuring that all members can easily
    contribute to the successful finish of the final project.

  \item {\bf Project Presentations}: April 28, 2014

    Using slides and demonstrations as needed, you and your team will give a short ten-minute presentation of your final
    results and participate in a five minute question and answer session.

\end{enumerate}

In adherence to the honor code, students should complete this assignment while only collaborating with those students
who are a part of their chosen team. While it is appropriate for students in this class to have high-level
conversations about the assignment with non-team members, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the team that
discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the team that produces an assignment that is identical to,
or merely variations on, the work of someone not on the team.  As such, deliverables that are nearly identical to the
work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the \mbox{Honor Code}.
