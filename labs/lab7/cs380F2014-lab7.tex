\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment Seven \\ Implementing and Evaluating Database-Centric
Applications}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Seven}{Due: November 11, 2014}

\section*{Introduction}

Chapter 5 of your textbook introduces advanced concepts in the structure query language (SQL), with an initial focus on
topics like accessing a database from a programming language. In this laboratory assignment, you will leverage the
example in Figure 5.1 of the textbook to ultimately implement your own database-centric application based on a schema
that you visualized and manipulated in the past two assignments. In addition to using a simple Java program that uses a
databases, you will learn more about the configuration and use of the HyperSQL database engine.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

You and your partner should always use a Git repository, hosted by Bitbucket, to store the source
code, database files, and all of the other deliverables required by this assignment. The repository must be shared with
the instructor and the version control log should accurately reflect each student's contribution to this assignment. In
addition, this assignment invites your partnership to submit one printed version of the following deliverables; each
member should write and submit their own version of the first deliverable. Please see the instructor if you have
questions about the deliverables that you must turn in for this assignment.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item A two paragraph commentary on the work that each team member completed. 
  \item A description of the eXtensible markup language and its features, strengths, and weaknesses.
  \item An explanation of the binary serialization method provided by the Java language.
    \item The final version of the source code for your serialization benchmarking framework.
      \item Output from at least five runs of your benchmarks, demonstrating features and correctness.
  \item A detailed report addressing the performance trade-offs associated with serialization.
  \item A reflection on the challenges that you faced when completing this laboratory assignment.
\end{enumerate}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment while exclusively collaborating with the
other member of their team. While it is appropriate for students in this class---who are not in the same team---to have
high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the team that discusses
the principles underlying a problem with another team and the team that produces an assignment that is identical to, or
merely a variation on, the work of another team.  Deliverables from one team that are nearly identical to the work of
another team will be taken as evidence of violating Allegheny College's \mbox{Honor Code}.

% Before you turn in this assignment, you also must ensure that the course instructor has read access to your Bitbucket
% repository that is named according to the convention {\tt cs380F2014-<your user name>}.  Please see the instructor if
% you have any questions about this assignment.
