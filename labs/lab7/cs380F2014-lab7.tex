\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Seven}{Due: November 11, 2014}

\section*{Introduction}

Chapter 23 of your textbook introduces the basics of the eXtensible markup language (XML), explaining how this
semi-structured approach to data management has been the defacto way to exchange data. In this laboratory assignment,
you will explore some of the trade-offs associated with the use of XML, with a particular focus on the time and space
overheads associated with storing data in this format. In particular, you will implement a benchmarking framework that
can serialize a Java object to both the binary and XML formats.  Finally, you and your partner will write a 
report that describes and explains the performance trends revealed by your benchmark.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

You and your partner should always use a Git repository, hosted by Bitbucket, to store the source code, XML files,
benchmark output, and all of the other deliverables required by this assignment. The repository must be shared with the
course instructor and the version control log should accurately reflect each student's contribution to this assignment. In
addition, this assignment invites your partnership to submit one printed version of the following deliverables; each
member should write and submit their own version of the first deliverable. Please see the instructor if you have
questions about the deliverables that you must turn in for this assignment.

\begin{enumerate}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
  \item A two paragraph commentary on the work that each team member completed. 
  \item A description of the eXtensible markup language and its features, strengths, and weaknesses.
  \item An explanation of the binary serialization method provided by the Java language.
  \item The final version of the source code for your serialization benchmarking framework.
  \item Output from at least five runs of your benchmarks, demonstrating features and correctness.
  \item A detailed report addressing the performance trade-offs associated with serialization.
  \item A reflection on the challenges that you faced when completing this laboratory assignment.
\end{enumerate}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment while exclusively collaborating with the
other member of their team. While it is appropriate for students in this class---who are not in the same team---to have
high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the team that discusses
the principles underlying a problem with another team and the team that produces an assignment that is identical to, or
merely a variation on, the work of another team.  Deliverables from one team that are nearly identical to the work of
another team will be taken as evidence of violating Allegheny College's \mbox{Honor Code}.

% Before you turn in this assignment, you also must ensure that the course instructor has read access to your Bitbucket
% repository that is named according to the convention {\tt cs380F2014-<your user name>}.  Please see the instructor if
% you have any questions about this assignment.
